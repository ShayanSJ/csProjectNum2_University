# Quadratic Equation Solver and Pseudo Random Number Generator

This project is a simple application developed for the Technical and Vocational University as part of your coursework. It's written in C# using the .NET Framework and WinForms. The application serves as both a Quadratic Equation solver and a Pseudo Random Number Generator.

## Features

- **Quadratic Equation Solver:** The application allows users to input coefficients of a quadratic equation and calculates its roots using the quadratic formula.
- **Pseudo Random Number Generator:** This feature generates pseudo-random numbers using an algorithm that relies on milliseconds as seeds, without using any existing functions or methods from libraries.
